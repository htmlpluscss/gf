					Summary
				</h2>

				<p>
					Cryptocurrency and blockchain have existed for a long time, but there has never been a decentralized space for artists to experiment. In the art world, cryptocurrencies including NFTs are vehicles for artists to fulfill their needs and dreams in a better way. It is not only about buying low and selling high. We aim to build a space to support the ideology of artists and maintain the integrity of arts, while involving some elements of crypto. In Gallery Finance, you can open a workshop to let the community design and produce NFTs together based on voting, run your own auction for your arts and, store and exhibit your arts forever through decentralized storage.

				<h2 id="workshop">
					Workshop
				</h2>

				<p>
					It is sad that defi projects create NFTs and let people mine. Community never had a say in the design and creation of NFTs. The motivation for most of them was wrong. If the intention is to create some fine arts, why would you randomly put free money to mine something you actually do not like. Money takes over your art appreciation intention. Gallery Finance never creates nor designs NFTs, but it is a workshop for the community to build NFTs together. Here, you can create a community workshop to let people vote for themes and select arts and make NFTs.
				</p>

				<h2 id="auction">
					Auction
				</h2>

				<p>
					Auction is a fancy subject, and auctions for arts are even fancier. We think artists should always benefit from transactional values generated from their arts. They should always get some benefits from the change in hands of their arts. So, in gallery, we share transaction fees with the original creators of NFTs to make sure artists are benefitted.

				<h2 id="exhibition-hall">
					Exhibition hall
				</h2>

				<p>
					Decentralized storage like Arweave provides a good solution for artists who want to store their pieces permanently. We think this is spiritually in demand that an artist wants his arts to be exhibited forever. Exhibition hall is the place for artists to display their arts and write stories about their pieces. All exhibited arts are stored in decentralized storage.

				<h2 id="glf-token">
					GLF tokens
				</h2>

				<p>
					GLF tokens should be in the hands of artists. The main functionalities and utilities of GLF tokens are as followed:
				</p>

				<ol>

					<li>
						Workshop – token holders can stake to start a workshop, and participants use tokens to participate in the workshop and vote for artworks.
					</li>

					<li>
						Auction – transaction fees will be used to purchase GLF tokens. Half of the transaction fees will be shared with original creators of the NFTs and the other half will be burned forever.
					</li>

					<li>
						Exhibition hall – Artists can use GLF tokens to purchase decentralized storage and store their arts and exhibit arts on gallery finance
					</li>

					<li>
						Pools – the initial distribution of GLF tokens will implement liquidity mining where participants need to stake in the liquidity pool to mine GLF tokens. In the future, the pool will be used to mine NFT arts generated from workshops.
					</li>

				</ol>

				<p class="total-tokens">
					Total supply of GLF tokens is 30,000
				</p>

				<h2>
					Token distribution
				</h2>

				<p>
					We distribute our tokens through Farming and the first artist workshop. 15000 tokens will be allocated to farming and 15000 tokens will be allocated through the first artist workshop.
